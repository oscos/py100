Instructions:

    Without running the following code, determine what it will print:

    def multiples_of_three():
        divisor = 1

        for dividend in range(3, 31, 3):
            print(f'{dividend} / {divisor} = 3')
            divisor += 1

    multiples_of_three

Solution:

"""


print("Becuase the last line was missing the `()` "
      "the function was never invoked. "
      "Therefore, no is no output.")
