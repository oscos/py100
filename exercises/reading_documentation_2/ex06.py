Instructions:

    How many arguments does the str.join method expect? 
    What happens if you call it with fewer or more arguments?

Solution:

Invoking join with too many or without any arguments will raise a TypeError.

Definition from Python Docs

Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable.
A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable,
including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string
providing this method.
