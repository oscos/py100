Instructions:

    Locate the documentation for the list built-in object in Python Documentation.

    How can we access the second element ('and') in the list ['fish', 'and', 'chips']?

Solution:

    We can use bracket notation `[]` to access the elements of a list.  
    Note that an index of a list starts at 0.

    You can find information on this by navigating over to: 
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list 

    Locate the Common link:

    HERE: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-common

    OR HERE: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations

meal_list = ['fish', 'and', 'chips']
