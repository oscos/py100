Instructions:

    How can you check if a variable holds a value that is a list? Given two variables, verify whether the values they hold are lists.

    some_value1 = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
    some_value2 = 'I leave you my Kingdom, take good care of it.'

Solution:


"""

some_value1 = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
some_value2 = 'I leave you my Kingdom, take good care of it.'

print(isinstance(some_value1, list))
print(isinstance(some_value2, list))
